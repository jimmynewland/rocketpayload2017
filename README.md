# rocketpayload2017
9-DOF Sensor package meant to ride along with the Texas A&amp;M Rocketry team summer launch.

This code is based on code written by Adafruit authors for the 9-DOF sensor and the Feather Adalogger. Some minor changes were added
and the code was combined into one functioning chunk of code. Since the payload must be stand-alone, all code requiring user intervention
was removed.
